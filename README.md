# Self-Healing Machine Learning System for Startup Success Prediction

This repository contains the implementation of the final year BCA (Data Science) project submitted to Amity University Online.

## Project Overview
The project focuses on predicting startup success and failure in India using machine learning classification models. It also demonstrates a basic self-healing mechanism that detects data pattern changes and triggers retraining to maintain model reliability over time.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Project Structure
- data/ : datasets used for analysis
- notebooks/ or scripts/ : data preprocessing and model training code
- results/ : outputs, logs, or evaluation summaries
- README.md : project description
