This repository contains the implementation of the final year BCA (Data Science) project submitted to Amity University Online.

## Project Overview
The project focuses on predicting startup success and failure in India using machine learning classification models. It also demonstrates a basic self-healing mechanism that detects data pattern changes and triggers retraining to maintain model reliability over time.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Project Structure
- data/ : datasets used for analysis
- notebooks/ or scripts/ : data preprocessing and model training code
- results/ : outputs, logs, or evaluation summaries
- README.md : project description

## Note
This repository is provided for academic evaluation and reference purposes only.

## Project–Report Mapping

This repository contains the implementation corresponding to the academic project report
titled **“A Self-Healing Machine Learning System for Predicting Startup Success and Failure in India”**.

- Exploratory Data Analysis: `01_eda.py`
- Model Training and Evaluation: `02_model_training.py`
- Self-Healing Mechanism (Monitoring & Retraining): `03_self_healing.py`
- Dataset used in analysis: `startup_funding.csv`

The code structure and logic directly align with the methodology, architecture,
and analysis described in Chapters 3, 4, and 5 of the project report.
